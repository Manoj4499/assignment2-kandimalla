## Cricket Sport
Cricket is a very popular sport that is played all over the world. It can be played every where like beaches, grounds, etc.., Two teams play together to winning a trophy. In cricket they are three formates like T20, ODI, Test. It gives the **thrilling experience** while watching game in the stadium every one choose their favourite players and team chears to them. **Batting, fielding, Bowling** are some aspects in the sport. I love to bat mostly there are different types of bowling and according to that you have to play. while batting hitting **sixes and fours** which are boundaries of the sport gives the some power to the audience and player as well as the scrore board increases fastly only dealing with the boundaries. I like **Sachin Tendulkar** he also called as god of cricket. He done the 100 Centuries the Cricket still no one brak his record.
